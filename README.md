# MiBici: Guadalajara's Bike-Sharing System & COVID-19

## Introduction

[MiBici](https://www.mibici.net/) (MyBike) is Guadalajara's public bike sharing system in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Created in 2014, the system has over 3,200 
bikes and 300 stations available in the municipalities of Guadalajara, Zapopan, and Tlaquepaque. MiBici consists of a line of bikes that are locked into a network 
of docking stations throughout the municipalities. To use the bikes, one must purchase a subscription. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to 
any other station in the system. Bikes are available every day of the year from 05:00 AM to 00:59 AM the next day and are designed to be used for an unlimited number 
of trips so long as each trip is less than 30 minutes (on Sundays, this is 45 minutes). When bikes are used for periods of more than 30 minutes, additional charges 
are incurred. The program acts as a complement or extension to other transportation systems in the area [MiBici FAQs](https://www.mibici.net/es/preguntas-frecuentes/).

As such, the goal of this project is to explore and visualize how cycling behaviors have changed in Guadalajara and its surrounding municipalities due to the COVID-19 
pandemic (between January 2017 and December 2022).

## Questions

1. How has the number of trips taken changed pre and post COVID?
2. Has the average trip duration changed over time?
3. What times of day are most popular to use the MiBici system?
4. What are the most popular pairs of start/end stations?
